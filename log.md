# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Just started the challenge, will be working on a game plan and working through exercises on Udemy Web Dev Javascript bootcamp by Colt Steele 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am getting better at Javascript, focusing on one language at a time is much more helpful than dabbling here and there. The UM Bootcamp was great except I wish it wasn't virtual and that everyone gave the same effort.
